# Affordify
Affordify is a web application built with Spring Boot as the backend framework and React as the frontend library. This platform allows users to search for various categories of food products, including fruits, vegetables, and meat, at affordable prices.

With Affordify, users can easily search and filter their desired food products based on a variety of criteria, such as pricing, customer reviews, and special offers. Our search engine uses web scraping technology to extract data from a list of ecommerce websites, ensuring that you get the best deals and the freshest products available.

## Smells
The smells identified in the project are majorly justifiable.
Feature concentration and Unstable Dependency shows in our project is filled with more classes than it should, however we have ensured that they follow Single Responsibility Principle(SRP) and are related to each other and can not be split into multiple packages.

Other majorly detected smells are unutilized abstraction, however, all the classes are used up somewhere and are required in this project.

We resolved all the magic number implementation smells apeared in our project.
Most implementation smells including long parameter list are the ones from constructors and there is a need for all the params as stated and hence can not be broken down. Also the long statements are used for object initialization and are non-breakable.

### Test coverage
-  The test class coverage in our project is 90%.
